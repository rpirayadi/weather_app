# Weather Application
We have implemented a weather forecast application which allows the user to view weather forecast of cities including temperature and wind speed using apis provided by [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) and [positionstack](https://positionstack.com/). It also allows the user to add and remove cities to/from their favorite list and sort them by name or temperature! It uses terminal as user interface. Following is a list of different app menus.
## Main Menu
You can sign up and then sign in with your username & password!
